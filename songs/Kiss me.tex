\verse{1}%
[D]{} Kiss me [Dmaj7]{} out of the bearded barley.
[D7]{} Nightly, [Dmaj7]{} beside the green, green [D]grass.
Swing, swing, [Dmaj7]{} swing the spinning step.
[D7]{} You wear those shoes and I will [G]{} wear that dress.

\chorus%
Oh oh, [Emi]{} kiss [A]me [D]{} beneath the [Hmi]milky twilight.
[Emi]{} Lead  [A]me [D]{} out on the [D7]moonlit [Emi]{floor}.
Lift your [A]open hand
[D]{} Strike up the [D/C#]band and make the [Hmi7]fireflies dance,
[D/A]silver moon's [Gmi7]sparkling. [Asus4]{}
[A|]{} So kiss [D]me. [Dmaj7|]{} [D7|]{} [Dmaj7|]{}

\verse{2}%
Kiss me, down by the broken tree house
Swing me, upon its hanging tire
Bring, bring,  bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map
\repchor\ \rep2
... \rl so kiss me\rr{3}
