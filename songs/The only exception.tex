\begin{song}{The Only Exception}{Paramore}{20pt}
\verse{1}%
[C]When I was younger I saw my daddy [Gmi]cry and curse at the [Fmaj7]wind
He [C]broke his own heart and I watched as he tried to [Gmi]reassemble [Fmaj7]it
And [C]my momma swore that she would never let [Gmi]herself for[Fmaj7]get
And [C]that was the day that I promised I'd never sing of [Gmi]love
if it does not [Fmaj7]exist, but darling

\chorus%
[C]You are the only exception, [Gmi]You are the [Fmaj7]only exception
[C]You are the only exception, [Gmi]You are the [Fmaj7]only exception [C]{}

\verse{2}%
Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this, keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

\chorus But you are the only exception\dots

\verse{*}%
I've got a [Dmi]tight grip on reality but I can't 
let [C]go of what's in front of me [G]here
I know you're [Dmi]leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me [C]with some kind of proof it's not a [G]dream, whoa [F]{}

\chorus But you are the only exception\dots (2$\times$)

\verse{*}%
And [Aadd11]I'm on my [F]way to believing [C]{}
Oh, and [Aadd11]I'm on my [F]way to believing [C]{}
