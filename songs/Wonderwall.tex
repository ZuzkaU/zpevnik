\verse{1}%
[Emi7|]{}Today is [G]gonna be the day
That they're [Dsus4]gonna throw it back to [A7sus4]you
[Emi7|]{}By now you [G]should've somehow
Rea[Dsus4]lised what you gotta [A7sus4]do
[Emi7]I don't believe that [G]anybody
[Dsus4]Feels the way I [A7sus4]do about you [Cadd9|]{now} [Dsus4 A7sus4]{}

\verse{2}%
Backbeat the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody 
feels the way I do about you now

\verse{*}%
And [Cadd9]all the roads we [Dsus4]have to walk are [Emi7]winding
And [Cadd9]all the lights that [Dsus4]lead us there are [Emi7]blinding
[Cadd9]There are many [Dsus4]things that I would
[G]Like to [D/F#|]{say} to [Emi7]you
but I [G]don't know [A7sus4]how

\chorus%
Because [Cadd9|]{maybe} [Emi7 G]{}
You're [Emi7]gonna be the one that [Cadd9]saves me [Emi7 G]{}
And [Emi7|]{after} [Cadd9|]{all} [Emi7 G]{}
You're my [Emi7]wonderwall [Cadd9 Emi7 G (Emi7)]{}

[(Dsus4)]{}

\verse{3}%
Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realised what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
feels the way I do about you now

\verse{*}%
And all the roads that lead you there are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
but I don't know how

\chorus%
\rl I said [Cadd9|]{maybe} [Emi7 G]{}
You're [Emi7]gonna be the one that [C]saves me [Emi7 G]{}
And [Emi7|]{after} [Cadd9|]{all} [Emi7 G]{}
You're my [Emi7]wonderwall [Cadd9 Emi7 G Emi7|]{}\rr{}

I said [Cadd9]maybe (I said [Emi7]maybe) [G]{}
You're [Emi7]gonna be the one that [Cadd9]saves me (that [Emi7]saves me) [G]{}
You're [Emi7]gonna be the one that [Cadd9]saves me (that [Emi7]saves me) [G]{}
You're [Emi7]gonna be the one that [Cadd9]saves me (that [Emi7]saves me) [G Emi7]{}
