\begin{song}{Where the wild roses grow}{Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds}{80pt}
\chorus%
They [Emi]call me The Wild [Ami_]{Ro}[Emi]se
But my [G]name was Elisa [H]Day
Why they [Emi]call me it I do not [Ami_]{kn}[Emi]ow
For my name was E[D]lisa [Emi]Day

\verse{1}%
From the [Emi]first day I saw her I knew [G]she was the one
She [Ami]stared in my eyes and [H]smiled
For her [Emi]lips were the colour of the [G]roses
That [Ami]grew down the river, all [H]bloody and wild

When he knocked on my door and entered the room
My trembling subsided in his sure embrace
He would be my first man, and with a careful hand
He wiped all the tears that ran down my face

\chorus ...

\verse{2}%
On the second day I brought her a flower
She was more beautiful than any woman I'd seen
I said, ``Do you know where the wild roses grow
So sweet and scarlet and free?"

On the second day he came with a single red rose
He said ``Give me your loss and your sorrow"
I nodded my head, as I lay on the bed
``If I show you the roses, will you follow?"

\chorus ...

\verse{3}%
On the third day he took me to the river
He showed me the roses and we kissed
And the last thing I heard was a muttered word
As he knelt above me with a rock in his fist

On the last day I took her where the wild roses grow
And she lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief
And I kissed her goodbye, said, ``All beauty must die"
And I lent down and planted a rose 'tween her teeth

\chorus%
...for my name was Elisa Day,
For my name was Elisa Day
