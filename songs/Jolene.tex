\begin{song}{Jolene}{Dolly Parton}{100pt}
\chorus%
Jo[Ami]lene, Jo[C]lene, Jo[G]lene, Jo[Ami]lene
I'm [G]begging of you, please don't take my [Ami]man
Jo[Ami]lene, Jo[C]lene, Jo[G]lene, Jo[Ami]lene
[G]Please don't take him [Emi]just because you [Ami]can

\verse{1}%
Your [Ami]beauty is be[Ami]yond compare
With [G]flaming locks of [Ami]auburn hair
With [G]ivory skin and [Em]eyes of emerald [Ami]green
Your [Ami]smile is like a [C]breath of spring
Your [G]voice is soft like [Ami]summer rain
And [G]I cannot com[Em]pete with you, Jo[Ami]lene

\verse{2}%
He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

\chorus

\verse{3}%
You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

\chorus
