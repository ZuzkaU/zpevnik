\begin{song}{Where is my mind}{Pixies}{70pt}
\verse{1}%
With your [E]feet in the air and your [C#mi]head on the ground [G#] ~ [A] ~
[E|]{} Try [C#mi]this trick and [G#]spin it, [A]yeah
[E|]{} Your head will col[C#mi]lapse
But there's [G#]nothing in it
And you'll [A]ask yourself

\chorus%
[E|]{} Where is my [C#mi]mind?
[G#|]{} Where is my [A]mind?
Whe[E]re is my [C#mi]mind? [G#] ~ [A] ~ [E] ~ [C#mi] ~ [G#] ~ [A] ~
[E]Way [G#]out in the [A]water, see it [Ami]swimming. [C#mi] ~ [H] ~

\verse{2}%
I was swimmin' in the Caribbean
Animals were hiding behind the rock
Except the little fish
But they told me, he swears
Tryin' to talk to me, coy koi
