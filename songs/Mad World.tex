\verse{1}%
[Emi|]{}All around me are fa[G]miliar faces
[D]Worn out places, [A]worn out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head, I want to drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

\chorus%
[Emi|]{}And I find it kinda [A]funny, I find it kinda [Emi]sad
The dreams in which I'm [A]dying are the best I've ever [Emi]had
I find it hard to [A]tell you, I find it hard to [Emi]take
When people run in [A]circles, it's a very, very
[Emi|]{}Mad [A]world
[Emi|]{}Mad [A]world


\verse{2}%
Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
And I feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Went to school, and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello, teacher, tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me
