\begin{song}{The Hanging Tree}{Hunger Games}{65pt}
\verse{1}%
Are [Ami]you, are [Dmi|]{you} [Ami]coming to the [E]tree
Where they [Ami]strung up a [Dmi]man they [E(G)]say who murdered [Ami]three.
[Ami]Strange things did [F]happen here no [Ami]stranger would it [D]be
If we [Ami]met up at [Dmi]midnight [Emi]in the hanging [Ami]tree.

\verse{2}%
Are you, are you coming to the tree
Where the dead man called out for his love to flee.
Strange things did happen here no stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree.

\verse{3}%
Are you, are you coming to the tree
Where I told you to run so we'd both be free.
Strange things did happen here no stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree.

\verse{4}%
Are you, are you coming to the tree
Wear a necklace of rope side by side with me.
Strange things did happen here no stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hanging tree.
